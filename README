Bunnylove is a simple anonymous Valentine's message-sending web site I made for the MetaChat[1] community. It also can be used to send scary Halloween messages.

The authentication is tied heavily to the MetaChat user system, but in the spirit of free software I've released the code under the GNU Affero GPL v3 (see LICENSE).

Culturally, too, this whole thing is tied pretty heavily to MetaChat, so it may not make much sense to anyone else.
