<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>In the interests of full disclosure, here's some information about <%= @site_name %>, how it's run, and the security and privacy measures that are in place.</p>
<ul>
  <li><%= @site_name %> is produced and run by me, <a href="http://www.feedmechocolate.com/">chrismear</a>. It is hosted on a server operated by my company, <a href="http://www.odegy.com/">Odegy</a>. It is not officially endorsed by MetaChat.</li>
  <li>The password you choose for <%= @site_name %> is stored only in an encrypted form, so there is no way for someone to read your password.</li>
  <li>The messages you send on <%= @site_name %> are stored only in an obfuscated way, so that there's no chance of me accidentally reading any of them while I'm maintaining the site.</li>
  <li>If I have to, it <em>is</em> possible for me to manually dig in to the database, decode the messages, and figure out who is sending them. However, I would only do this in exceptional circumstances (such as needing to track down someone who's sending abusive messages). It goes without saying that I hope I won't have to do this.</li>
</ul>
